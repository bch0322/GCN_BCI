## Application to the BCI (brain computer interface)
 - EEG signal have been measured through electronics located in surpace of the brain which is non-euclidean space.
 - The electronics can be considered as nodes and the interaction have been defined through coordinated montage of electronics.
 - Spectral feature of EEG signal have been took as input in this experiments.
