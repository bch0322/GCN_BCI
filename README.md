  Defferrard, MichaÃ«l, Xavier Bresson, and Pierre Vandergheynst. "Convolutional neural networks on graphs with fast localized spectral filtering." arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.09375 (2016).

## Application to the BCI (brain computer interface)
 - **Motor imagery EEG signal** have been measured through electronics located in surface of the brain which is **non-euclidean space**.
 - The electronics can be considered as **nodes** and the interaction (**edge**) have been defined through coordinated montage of electronics.
 - Spectral feature of EEG signal have been took as input in this experiments.
